Generally cannot be used to compare algorithms.

Week 2 (Recurrences)

Question 1
Which of the following is true of the number of comparisons used by Mergesort?

Answers:-
Is less than N lg N + N/4 for all N

Has periodic behavior

Exactly N lg N when N is a power of 2

Order of growth is N lg N
